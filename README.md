Description:
This project is a Speech Recognition System which allows the user to execute certain commands using Voice Lines. I have made this possible using the Speech_recognition and OS module of Python.

Features:
1. Speech Recognition.
2. Real Time Processing of Audio.
3. Execution of Tasks based on Key Words.

Installation ( prerequesites ):
1. Python 3.11 or 3.12
2. Libraries: Speech_Recognition, os, webbrowser
   { in terminal type: pip install (name of module) }

Setup:
1. open file in code editor and change keyword names and directory of your options
1. open terminal
2. type cd and the directory of python file and press "Enter"
3. type python and name of speech_recognition.py

Usage:
Start the program by typing (python speech_recognition.py),
when it says ( Listening... ) say the key words you've assigned for your specific tasks to be performed,
keep doing this until you're done,
then say "stop" to exit the program.

Example: 
Listening...
( say 'Google' )
google will open
